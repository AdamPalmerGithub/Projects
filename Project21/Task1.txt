1. Normalisation is a process for evaluating and corretion table structures to lower data redundancies, lowering the chance of anomalies.

2. 1NF is the first stage of normal form, used to eliminate repeating groups usually through the removal of null values.

3. 2NF is the second stage of normal form, this stage is used to remove partial dependencies.

4. 3NF is the third stage of normal form, this stage is used to remove all transitive dependencies

5. Foreign keys are columns that link to the primary key columns in other tables
